## Versions and pinning a release

See [releases](https://github.com/lkrdev/dashboard-tabs/releases) for the latest versions. The CDN is updated automatically when a new version is released and you can pin your extension to a specific version with `url: "https://cdn.lkr.dev/apps/dashboard-tabs/<release>/bundle.js"`.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm package manager
- Looker instance with extension framework enabled

### Build Process

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Development Mode**:
   ```bash

   # HTTPS development server (recommended for Looker)
   npm run dev:https

   # HTTP development server (recommended for development with a tunnel like cloudflared)
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Production Build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Manifest Configuration

The extension is configured through an application in your project's `manifest.lkml`:

```lookml
application: dashboard_tabs {
  label: "Dashboard Tabs"
  url: "https://localhost:8080/bundle.js"
  entitlements: {
    core_api_methods: [
      "me", 
      "dashboard", 
      "search_dashboards", 
      "folder_dashboards", 
      "board", 
      "search_boards", 
      "folder", 
      "search_folders",
      "create_board",
      "create_board_section",
      "create_board_item"
    ]
    navigation: yes
    use_embeds: yes
    use_iframes: yes
    new_window: yes
    use_form_submit: yes
  }
  mount_points: {
    standalone: yes
  }
}
```

If developing locally, you can use `url: "https://localhost:8080/bundle.js"`. If you are modifying the extension and don't have access to a CDN, you can run `npm run build` to generate a bundle.js file in the `dist` directory. Drag this file to your Looker project while in dev mode and then use `file: "bundle.js"` in the manifest instead of `url`.

### Required API Permissions

The extension requires the following Looker API methods:

- **User Management**: `me` - Get current user information
